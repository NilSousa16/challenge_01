# Challenge 01 - Concepts about Node.js

Application with initial concepts about Node.js

### Description

In this challenge, it was necessary to create an application to practice what has been learned so far in Node.js. Basic Node.js concepts were used.

The created application allows you to store information at run time, allowing the creation, listing, updating and removal of existing information.

 ### Configuration for Development

Use the package manager to install the project's dependencies.
```sh
yarn
```
### API

```sh
http://localhost:3333
```
It can be modified in the file called `server.js`.

### Testes

To run the tests use the commands below:
```sh
